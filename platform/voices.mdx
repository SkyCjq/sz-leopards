## Introduction

The Thoughtly Voice Library is a collection of pre-built Voices that you can use with your Voice Agents. Each Voice has a unique personality and style, making it easy to find the perfect fit for your project.

Voices are derived from multiple platforms. Currently supported platforms are:

- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.com)
- [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai): Available for v1.5 Agents only. Enable Experimental Features to access ([learn more](/company/changelog#february-2025)).

## Finding Voices

Voices are organized by language, gender, and style to make it easy to find the perfect fit for your Voice Agent. You can browse the full list of Voices on the [Voice Library](https://app.thoughtly.com/voice) page.

You can also use the search bar to find Voices by name if you know what you're looking for. Voices for all supported platforms will be displayed in the search results.

Preview a Voice by clicking on the play button next to the Voice name. This will play a short audio clip of the Voice so you can hear what it sounds like.

## Cloning a Voice

To clone a Voice, click on the **Clone Voice** button in the Voice Library. You can then either record a sample of your voice, or upload an audio file to be used as a reference for the new Voice.

Once you are happy with the preview, click **Clone**. After a few moments, the new Voice will be added to your account and you can use it with your Voice Agents.

These cloned Voices are private, unique to your account, and cannot be shared with other users. Voice clones are powered by the [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai) `sonic` model.

## Saving a Voice

To save a Voice to your account, click on the "Save" button next to the Voice name. This will add the Voice to your account so you can use it with your Voice Agents.

### Premium Voices

Some platforms charge a higher fee for their Voices. These Voices are marked next to the platform name with a note like "3x credits." This means that, when you use this Voice with your Voice Agent, it will consume three times as many Credits as a standard Voice. Learn more about [Credits](/platform/billing).

### Using Saved Voices

To use a Saved Voice from the Voice Library, you can select it from the Voice Selector in the [Agent Builder](/build/agent-builder/configuration). This will apply the Voice to your Voice Agent so it speaks with the selected Voice.
