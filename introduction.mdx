## Getting Started

Thoughtly revolves around two important concepts: [Building](/build/) Agents and [Deploying](/deploy/) Agents.

### What is a Voice Agent?

A <b>Voice Agent</b> is a conversational interface that can interact with your customers over the phone, just like a human would. Agents can answer questions, provide information, and even take actions on your behalf.

As a brand new technology powered by cutting-edge [large language models](/resources/glossary#large-language-model), building a Voice Agent is typically reserved for only the most experienced machine learning and telephony engineers. Thoughtly simplifies this process by providing a simple platform that anyone can enjoy.

## Use Cases

Thoughtly enables you to build advanced Voice Agent that can handle a wide variety of use cases. Here are some examples of what you can build with Thoughtly:

### Inbound Calls

When customers call your <a href="deploy/phone-numbers/buying-phone-numbers">Thoughtly phone number</a>, your Voice Agent will answer the phone and interact with them just like a human would.

Alternatively, you can forward calls from your existing phone number to your Thoughtly Agent, or <a href="/deploy/sip">use SIP</a> to connect your Voice Agent to your existing phone system.

### Outbound Calls

Your Voice Agent can also make outbound calls to customers, clients, or leads. Calls can be made <a href="deploy/phone-numbers/buying-phone-numbers">using phone numbers on Thoughtly,</a> or you can <a href="deploy/phone-numbers/caller-id">use your existing phone numbers.</a>

    </Card>
</CardGroup>

### SMS

Your Agents also have the ability to <a href="deploy/sms">send and receive SMS messages</a> autonomously. When used in conjunction with your Voice Agent on phone calls, SMS can be a powerful tool for customer engagement.

Text messages can be sent during the call to share a link, collect information, or provide additional context. They can also be used to follow up with customers after the call has ended.
