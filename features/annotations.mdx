## Create annotations on messages

With annotations, you can add additional information to messages. This can be useful to comment on or add any other information that you want to add to a message for further analysis.

#### Usage

To create an annotation, follow these steps:

- Click the message you want to annotate on and a [Trace](/concepts#traces) details drawer will open.
- On the top right, click the annotation button.
- Here you will be able to add a comment, a link or any other information that you want to add to the message.
- Click the save button to save the annotation.

Once you have created an annotation, you will see it in the Trace details drawer under the annotations tab as well as next to the message in the messages view.

# Annotation Scoring

We have developed a customized scoring system for each annotation. To get started, you will need to create your scores on the settings page.

There are three types of score data you can choose from:

1) **Boolean**: A straightforward score that can be either true or false.
2) **Categorical**: A score that can be assigned to any category you have created.
3) **Likert Scale**: A predefined score with four selectable options.

Once you have created your scores, you can activate or deactivate them on the settings page.

Once your scores are activated, you will see them in the annotations tab. For each annotation you create, the score options will be available, allowing you to add more detailed information to your annotations.
