	### What Are Automations?

	- [**AI-Generated Variables**](/build/automations/overview#variables): Dynamically extract and use data from call transcripts to enrich workflows.
	- [**Conditionals**](/build/automations/actions#conditionals): Add branching logic with filters, switches, and if/else statements for complex workflows.

	#### Real-World Use Cases:
	- **Call Leads Instantly**: Trigger a call to new leads added to your CRM and update the CRM with the call outcome.
	- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetch real-time stock prices or customer history before connecting a call.
	- **Scheduled Outreach**: Set recurring workflows to check in with customers or send appointment reminders.

	## Conversational SMS üí¨

	This update brings powerful new capabilities to enhance how you interact with your customers via text, even during active phone calls.

<Update label="July 2024">
	## Caller ID Masking for Outbound Calls

	This feature allows you to ensure that your outbound calls appear to come from a specific phone number of your choice, providing a consistent and professional experience for your customers.

	<Frame>
		<iframe
			width="620"
			height="350"
			src="https://www.loom.com/embed/edb708c1d7bf46d987c88e72e3721953"
			title="Loom video player"
			frameborder="0"
			allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
			allowfullscreen
			style={{ borderRadius: 10 }}
		></iframe>
	</Frame>

	With Caller ID masking, you can mask your outbound phone calls to display a specific phone number that you‚Äôve added and verified on the platform. This is useful for businesses that want all calls to appear as if they are coming from a central or recognized number that is not owned by Thoughtly itself.

	**Setup**

	To enable Caller ID masking, navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section on the left-hand side of the platform, then select "Caller ID" in the top right corner. Enter the phone number you want to use, and click "Enable."

	After entering your phone number, you'll receive a validation call. Simply enter the six-digit validation code to confirm ownership, and you're all set!

	**Use Cases**

	- BYON (Bring Your Own Number): Use your existing phone number for outbound calls, then forward inbound calls to your Thoughtly agent.
	- Consistent Branding: Ensure that all customer interactions, whether by phone or text, reflect your brand's central contact number.
	- Improved Customer Trust: Calls appearing from a recognized number are more likely to be answered, leading to better engagement and fewer missed connections.

	Learn more on the [Caller ID](/deploy/phone-numbers/caller-id) docs page.

	## Rules & Training ü•á

	This update allows you to fine-tune and customize the behavior of your AI agents with unprecedented precision, ensuring they respond exactly the way you want in any given scenario.

			height="350"

			allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
			allowfullscreen
			style={{ borderRadius: 10 }}
		></iframe>
	</Frame>

	You can now train your AI agents directly through an intuitive interface. Simply interact with your agent, and if a response doesn't meet your expectations, you can modify it instantly. This allows for a more natural and efficient training process.

	Each rule you create is tied to a specific node in the conversation flow. This means you can manage, edit, or add new rules to individual parts of the conversation, giving you granular control over how your agent interacts with callers.

	Learn more on the [Rules & Training](/build/agent-builder/training-and-rules) docs page.
