## Introduction

A Receptionist is often the first point of contact for customers calling your business. By building a Voice Agent that can greet callers and direct them to the right department, you can provide a seamless experience for your customers.

Just like a human receptionist, your Voice Agent can answer common questions such as *"What are your hours of operation?"* or *"Can you connect me to sales?"*. By equipping your Voice Agent with the right tools, you can ensure that your customers are directed to the right department quickly and efficiently.

**The best part? Your Voice Agent can handle multiple calls at once, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.**

## Use Case Example

In this example, we're going to build a Voice Agent that can greet callers and direct them to the right department. For this scenario, we'll have three departments: Sales, Support, and Billing, each with their own individual phone number to route calls to.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully-functional Voice Agent that will:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Greet callers">
        Your Voice Agent will greet callers with a friendly message such as *"Thank you for calling Acme Corp. How can I help you today?"*
    </Step>
    <Step title="Direct callers to the right department">
        Your Voice Agent will ask callers which department they'd like to speak with and route the call accordingly.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Handle multiple calls at once">
        Your Voice Agent will be able to handle multiple calls at once, ensuring that no caller is left waiting.
    </Step>
</Steps>
