## Introduction

Customer Service is a critical part of any business. By building a Voice Agent that can provide existing customers with help and support, you can reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.

Just like a human agent, if you equip your Voice Agent with the right tools, they can handle a wide range of customer inquiries. From checking order status to troubleshooting common issues, your Voice Agent can provide customers with the help they need.

**The best part? Your Voice Agent can provide 24/7 support, freeing up your human agents to focus on more complex issues.**
