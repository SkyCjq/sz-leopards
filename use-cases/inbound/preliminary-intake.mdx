<Info>Preliminary Intake Voice Agents are a powerful, yet advanced use case typically leveraged by large enterprises. If you're new to building Voice Agents, we recommend starting with a simpler use case like [Receptionist](/use-cases/inbound/receptionist) or [Customer Service](/use-cases/inbound/customer-service).</Info>

## Introduction

In complex or highly-regulated businesses, it's common to require that customers provide information and certain disclosures are stated before the caller can speak to a human agent. Prior to transferring the call to a human agent, a Voice Agent can collect information from the caller, create a ticket, then transfer the call to the appropriate department and provide a [screen pop](/resources/glossary#screen-pop) to the human agent.

By building a Voice Agent that can handle the first stages of a caller's journey, you can reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction dramatically.

**The best part? Your Voice Agent can handle multiple calls at once, ensuring that no caller is left waiting. After hours, your Voice Agent can collect information and create a ticket for the next business day.**

## Use Case Example

In this example, we're going to build a Voice Agent that collects information from the caller before transferring the call to a human agent. For this scenario, we'll be using [Zendesk](/integrations/ticketing/zendesk) to create a ticket and transfer the call to the appropriate department.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully-functional Voice Agent that will:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Collect information">
        Your Voice Agent will ask the caller a series of questions to collect information such as their name, phone number, and reason for calling.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a ticket">
        Your Voice Agent will create a ticket in Zendesk with the information collected from the caller. The ticket will include a summary of the call and any relevant details.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Transfer the call">
        Your Voice Agent will transfer the call to the appropriate department and provide a screen pop to the human agent with the details of the ticket.
    </Step>
</Steps>
