## Introduction

Allowing customers to call in and schedule appointments can be a game-changer for your business. By building a Voice Agent that can handle appointment scheduling, you can reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.

Just like a human receptionist, your Voice Agent can handle a wide range of appointment scheduling tasks. From checking availability to rescheduling appointments, your Voice Agent can provide customers with the help they need.

**The best part? Your Voice Agent can handle multiple appointments at once, ensuring that no customer is left waiting.**

        If a customer needs to reschedule their appointment, your Voice Agent will be able to handle the entire process from start to finish.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Answer questions">
        Your Voice Agent will be able to answer common questions such as *"What services do you offer?"* or *"How much does a haircut cost?"*
    </Step>
</Steps>
