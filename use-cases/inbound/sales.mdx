## Introduction

Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) are the backbone of any sales team. They're responsible for qualifying leads, setting appointments, and nurturing relationships with potential customers. By building a Voice Agent that can handle these tasks, you can free up your SDRs to focus on closing deals and growing your business.

What if all of your existing SDRs could be promoted to Account Executives, and you could hire an army of Voice Agents to handle the top of the funnel? With Thoughtly, you can do just thatâ€“ and it only takes a few minutes to setup.

### Use Case Example

In this example, we're going to build a Voice Agent that answers incoming calls from leads, qualifies them, and sets appointments with your sales team. For this scenario, we'll be using [Salesforce](/integrations/crm/salesforce) as our CRM and [Cal.com](/integrations/scheduling/cal-com) to schedule appointments. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
	<Step title="Answer the phone">
        When a lead calls your sales line, your Voice Agent will answer just like a human would. They'll answer product questions, handle objections, and drive the conversation towards setting an appointment.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Qualify the lead">
        Your Voice Agent will ask the lead a series of questions to determine if they're a good fit for your product or service. If they are, your Voice Agent will move on to the next step. If not, they'll politely end the call.
	</Step>
    <Step title="Set an appointment">
        If the lead is qualified, your Voice Agent will schedule an appointment with your sales team. They'll check your sales team's calendar in real-time and find a time that works for both the lead and your team.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update your CRM">
        After the call, your Voice Agent will update your CRM with the results of the call, such as whether the lead is qualified or not, and the details of the appointment.
    </Step>
</Steps>
