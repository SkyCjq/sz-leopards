## Introduction

When a lead submits a form on your website, it's a clear signal that they're interested in your product or service. But how many of those leads are you actually following up with? How many deals are slipping through the cracks because your sales team is too busy to make those calls?

**Speed-to-lead** is critical in sales. The faster you can follow up with a lead, the more likely you are to close the deal. With Thoughtly, you can build a Voice Agent that will call leads who have submitted a form on your website, qualify them, and set appointments for your sales team.

<Note>
[Studies](https://velocify.com/blog/infographic-sales-processes-for-countless-conversions?_gl=1*1hfdjxy*_gcl_au*MTg3Njc2NDQ1Ni4xNzM0NDUwNzM0*_ga*MTE3MjQ0OTQ4My4xNzM0NDUwNzMw*_ga_7C6N0WZ5Q3*MTczNDQ1MDcyOS4xLjEuMTczNDQ1MDczOC41Ni4wLjA.) show that, on average, companies experience a **391%** increase in their conversion rate when they contact leads within the first minute of their inquiry.

## Use Case Example

In this example, we're going to build a Voice Agent sequence that calls leads who have submitted a form via [Typeform](/integrations/productivity/typeform). Your Voice Agent will qualify the lead and update your CRM. For this example, we'll be using [HubSpot](/integrations/crm/hubspot) as our CRM.

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have a fully-functional Voice Agent that will:

<Steps>
	<Step title="Call leads who have submitted a form">
		Follow up with leads who have submitted a form on your website, qualify them, and set appointments for your sales team. Your Voice Agent will update HubSpot with the results of each call, such as whether the lead is qualified or not.
	</Step>
	<Step title="If no answer, send a text">
		If your Voice Agent can't reach a lead by phone, they'll send a [Conversational SMS](/deploy/sms) to the lead's phone number. If the lead responds, your Voice Agent will interact with them just like they would over the phone.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Wait a day, then call again">
		If your Voice Agent still doesn't hear back from the lead, they'll wait a day and try calling again.
	</Step>
</Steps>
