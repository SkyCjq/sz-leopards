#### Voice Agent

A <b>Voice Agent</b> is a conversational interface that can interact with your customers over the phone, just like a human would. Agents can answer questions, provide information, and even take actions on your behalf.

#### Large Language Model

A <b>Large Language Model</b> is a type of machine learning model that is trained on a massive amount of text data. These models are capable of generating human-like text, and are used in a variety of applications including chatbots, translation, and voice agents ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)). Common providers of large language models include [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Meta](https://ai.facebook.com), [Groq](https://groq.com), and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language).

#### TTS

<b>TTS</b> stands for Text-to-Speech, a technology that converts written text into spoken words. TTS is used in a variety of applications including voice agents, audiobooks, and accessibility tools. Common TTS providers include [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io), [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai), and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech).

#### STT

<b>STT</b> stands for Speech-to-Text, a technology that converts spoken words into written text. STT is used in a variety of applications including voice agents, transcription, and accessibility tools. Common STT providers include [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com), [Gladia](https://gladia.io), [AssemblyAI](https://assemblyai.com), and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text).

#### Decision Tree

A <b>Decision Tree</b> is a flowchart-like structure that represents a series of decisions and their possible consequences. Decision trees are used in a variety of applications including machine learning, game theory, and business analysis. In the context of Voice Agents, decision trees are used to model the conversation flow and logic of the agent.

#### Happy Path

The <b>Happy Path</b> is the ideal sequence of events that leads to a successful outcome. In the context of Thoughtly's Voice Agents, the Happy Path represents the most direct and efficient way for the Agent to achieve its goal. By designing the conversation flow to follow the Happy Path, you can ensure that callers have a positive experience and achieve their desired outcome quickly and easily.

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

<b>RAG</b> (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as databases) with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs).  By combining this extra knowledge with its own language skills, the AI can write text that is more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your specific needs.

Thoughtly provides a powerful, yet easy-to-use RAG system called [Genius](/build/genius).
