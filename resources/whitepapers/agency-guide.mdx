## Purpose of an AI Agency

As millions of businesses transition to the new, AI-first world, the demand for AI solutions is skyrocketing. This presents a unique opportunity for entrepreneurs to build AI agencies that can help businesses navigate this new landscape. It's important to not just blindly believe this assumption, but to truly understand the underlying demand behind this generational transition.

### The Opportunity

Globally, there are over 156,000 phone calls made every second. That's 4.9 trillion phone calls each year ([source](https://www.sellcell.com/blog/how-many-phone-calls-are-made-a-day-2023-statistics/#:~:text=How%20many%20phone%20calls%20are%20made%20a%20second%3F&text=Across%20the%20world%2C%20we%20make%20a%20huge%2013.5%20billion%20phone,across%20the%20entire%20the%20globe)). Whether these are outbound or inbound, these calls are the lifeblood of both business and human relationships.

Businesses have relied on human agents to handle customer calls since the advent of the telephone. At it's best, software was able to help with routing via antiquated IVR systems. But now, using generative AI, we have the opportunity to replace human agents with AI agents that speak and engage with callers just like a human would.

This is a game-changer for businesses, as it allows them to provide 24/7 support, highly-scalable lead generation, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

### Why Businesses Hire Agencies

Inherently, businesses do one thing very well- this is their **core competency.**

Your neighborhood car wash cleans cars, dentists fix teeth, accountants do taxes, and even Thoughtly does one thing: we build software. So, what happens when a business needs to do something outside of their core competency?

When Thoughtly needs legal services, we hire a lawyer. When a dentist needs to do marketing, they hire a marketing agency. Doing this themselves is not only inefficient, but also a waste of resources, usually resulting in a subpar result.

**Businesses hire other businesses to do things outside of their core competency-** this is the basis of the agency model and the machine that powers the global economy.

### The Problem: Integration

When it comes to AI agencies, what is the need that businesses have that falls outside of their core competency? The answer is simple: **Integration.**

Each business uses a unique set of software, tools, and processes to run their business. Dentists might use [Dentrix](https://www.dentrix.com/) to manage their patients, car washes may use [Washify](https://washify.com/) to manage their customers, and real estate agents might use [Follow Up Boss](https://www.followupboss.com/) to manage their leads.

Over the coming years as businesses adopt Voice AI in droves, they will each have different requests and requirements for their AI agents. Each agent will connect to different systems, have different call cadences, and use different scripts. Could they do this themselves? Of course, just as I could learn how to do my own legal work for Thoughtly, but it would be a waste of my time and take my focus off of my core competency as a business owner.

This is where you come in.

### The Solution: AI Agencies

As the internet became mainstream, businesses sought expertise to create and manage their online presence through websites, leading to the rise of **web design agencies**. When social media first emerged, businesses needed guidance to navigate this new and rapidly evolving landscape, giving rise to the concept of **social media marketing agencies (SMMAs)**. Similarly, as search engines like Google became integral for local discovery, businesses required support to optimize their visibility in search results, which spurred the growth of **local SEO agencies**.

Over the next decade, we will see a seismic shift in call operations for small businesses. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join build an agency in a new industry that has the opportunity to grow even larger than the agencies of the early 21st century.

Enter, **AI agencies.**

At their core, AI agencies are simply **integration agencies**. They help businesses integrate AI into their existing systems, processes, and workflows. This is a new industry that is just beginning to take shape, and the opportunities are endless- this is why Thoughtly could never service every single small business requirement on our own, and why we are so excited to partner with agencies around the world to help them build their own AI agencies.

## Key Steps for Building Your AI Agency

Building an agency is about solving real problems for real people. It's not just about clicking around on software or deploying voice agents—it's about deeply understanding your clients and delivering value they can't ignore.

</Frame>

Here are four keys to help you create, scale, and sustain your AI agency with practical advice and examples:

### Step 1: Identify Your Core Competency  
*“Start with what you know and where you excel.”*

To get started, it's important to first understand *your* core competency. What do you do better than anyone else? What do you enjoy doing? What network are you most connected to? Who do you understand better than others? This is your core competency, and this will be the foundation of your AI agency—the skills, knowledge, or network that sets you apart.

This could be your understanding of a specific industry, like real estate, or a technical strength, like automating workflows. Identifying this early will help you focus your efforts and stand out in a crowded market.

**Example:** If you've spent the last few years in real estate, you might have a deep understanding of the industry's nuances, from lead generation to client management. Not only do you have a unique insight into the problems that real estate agents face, but you also have a network of real estate professionals who trust your expertise. This positions you perfectly to build an AI agency that serves the real estate industry.

**How to Find Your Core Competency:**

1. Reflect on your professional experiences and personal interests.
2. Consider the networks and communities you're already part of.
3. Ask yourself, “What do I do better than anyone else I know?”

### Step 2: Identify a Problem  
*“To solve meaningful problems, you must first listen.”*

Start by talking to as many people in your target industry as possible. Your goal is to uncover their challenges and inefficiencies. Don't pitch your solution yet—just listen. This will help you understand their struggles and identify opportunities to add value.

**How to Identify Problems:**

- **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: “What's the most time-consuming part of your day?” or “What's one process you wish were easier?”
- **Observe**: Attend industry meetups, read forums, or join online groups to see what people complain about.
- **Validate**: Look for patterns. If multiple people mention the same issue, it's likely a real problem worth solving.

**Example:** After speaking with a dozen law firm partners, you discover that they all struggle with the same issue: no one answers their phone on the weekends. They lose hundreds of potential leads to competitors each week. This insight could lead to developing an AI voice agent that answers calls on weekends, capturing leads that would otherwise be lost, and sends them to their CRM for follow-up by their team. And just like that, you've identified a problem that you can solve, and you have a potential client who is willing to pay you to solve it.

### Step 3: Build for One  
*“Your first customer is your North Star—treat them like royalty.”*

Once you've identified a problem, use your network to find your first client. This client is the most important relationship you'll have in the early days of your agency. Focus all your energy on solving their problem and delivering an exceptional experience.

Offer your first customer a discount on your services. In some cases, you may even want to do the work for free. Either way, you should be taking a loss on your first client, but this is an investment in your future.

In exchange for the deal of a lifetime, your first client will agree to three things: **1) feedback, 2) a case study, and 3) referrals.** Make sure to specify how *many* referrals you expect, and draft this stipulation within your contract. This is the foundation of your agency's growth.

**How to Make Your First Customer Happy:**

1. **Start Small**: Start with a single process or task, then expand as you prove value. Clients will often have an endless list of problems they want you to solve, but you should only focus on one at a time. Only move to the next problem once you have confidently solved the first.
2. **Milestone Your Deliverables**: Break down your solution into manageable milestones, and celebrate each one with your client. You should have well-defined objectives for each problem you solve.
3. **Communicate Constantly**: Keep them updated on progress and involve them in key decisions. Always over-communicate.
4. **Be Flexible**: Adapt your solution to their feedback—it's better to overdeliver than to promise perfection upfront.

**Example:** Let's say you're working with a dentist to implement an AI appointment booking system. Spend time shadowing their staff, understanding their workflow, and tailoring the system to fit seamlessly with their existing software. If it means hopping on multiple calls to troubleshoot, do it.

### Step 4: Build the Machine
*“Your first customer isn't just a client—they're your proof of concept.”*

Once you've delivered value to your first client, document their success in detail. A case study is a powerful marketing tool to showcase your agency's impact and build credibility with future clients. 

**How to Build a Case Study:**

Based on what I've seen, the best case studies come from a one-on-one conversation. Record and transcribe the conversation with your client, then use tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to build the transcript into a case study.

In the conversation, you should cover:

1. **Highlight the Problem**: Clearly describe the challenge the client faced before working with you.
2. **Explain Your Solution**: Outline what you implemented, how you did it, and why it worked.
3. **Show Results**: Include measurable, quantitative outcomes, like reduced costs, revenue generation, or number of net new leads.
4. **Use Testimonials**: Ask your client for a direct quote about their experience.

**Referrals Are Key:** Based on the advice above, your first client should now be ready to provide you with referrals. Armed with your new case study, your client will now be able to introduce you to their network of colleagues, and you can share their successes right away. Show your prospective new customers the value you provided to your first client, and tell them you'll provide them with the same results.

Finally, offer *those* referrals a discount on your services in exchange for their own case study and referrals. Keep this process going, and halve your discount each time. Eventually, the discount you provide will be negligible, but your new clients will feel like they are getting a good deal by working with you, and you will have a steady stream of new clients coming your way- all with zero marketing.

You've now built a powerful growth machine for your agency. This is the flywheel that will allow you to scale your agency from one client to one hundred clients, and beyond.


### The Cycle of Growth

By continuously focusing on client satisfaction and leveraging referrals, your agency can grow sustainably without relying heavily on paid advertising. Each satisfied client becomes an ambassador for your agency, opening doors to new opportunities.

This simple but powerful pattern—identify, solve, delight, document, and refer—creates a flywheel effect that can propel your agency to success. And remember: at every step, Thoughtly is here to support you with the tools and expertise to make your vision a reality.

## How to Leverage Thoughtly

Throughout the lifecycle of your agency, Thoughtly will be here to support your clients with all things Voice AI. With each step of your client's journey, here are some ways you can leverage Thoughtly to help your clients succeed:

### Marketing and Lead Generation

Over the last few years, I've spoken with thousands of agency owners about the opportunity of building an AI agency. One of the most common questions I receive is, *"how do I find clients?"* Marketing is expensive, and marketing well is a challenging skill to master. Fortunately, you don't have to do this alone.

After you've shown success with your early clients, you can apply to join the [Thoughtly Partner Program](/company/partners). This program is designed to help you grow your agency by providing you with the resources, support, training, certification, and marketing to help you succeed.

One key aspect of the program is the **Lead Marketplace,** a platform for top agencies to connect with businesses looking for Voice AI solutions. As Thoughtly grows and invests in marketing, leads are added to the Lead Marketplace daily. Once a lead is assigned to you, an introductory email will be sent by me to introduce you to the lead, and you can begin the sale.

Because these leads are typically at the bottom of the funnel, they are often ready to buy immediately. This is a powerful way to grow your agency without spending a dime on your own marketing.

### Contracting and Billing

Setting the foundation for the relationship with your clients, and ensuring you get paid for your work, is critical to the success of your agency. Thoughtly provides a number of tools to help you with this, with **Usage Reporting** as the foundation of this.

Each client you onboard will use Thoughtly to manage their calls, and each call costs [Credits](/platform/billing). While many agencies opt to cover their client's usage costs with higher fixed service fees, you can also pass these costs onto your clients. This is a great way to keep your own costs down, and it allows you to charge your clients based on their usage of Thoughtly.

There are three ways to track your client's usage of Thoughtly:

1. **Manual Reporting:** Each month, Thoughtly provides a detailed [Usage Report](/platform/settings) that details how many Credits were used by each client. You can use this report to bill your clients manually, but that's tedious.
2. **Automated Reporting:** Instead of manually pulling usage for each client, you can use [Automations](/build/automations/overview) to automatically send a webhook to your billing platform, CRM, or data warehouse to automatically keep a log of your client's usage. At the end of each billing cycle, you can tally up the total and add it as a line item on the invoice you send to your client.
3. **API:** If you want to get really fancy, you can use the [Thoughtly API](/developers) to automatically pull usage data for each client and send it to your billing platform. This is a more advanced solution, but it can give you more flexibility and remove the need for your own database of client data.

Typically, the final invoice you send to a client for any given month should be for their Thoughtly usage and additional fees for your services. The latter is typically a much larger portion of the invoice, and this is where you can make your money.

There are many ways to setup automated contracting and invoicing which we'll explore in the [Billing Your Clients](#billing-your-clients) portion of this guide.

### Integration

This is the most important part of your agency's success and where you can differentiate your agency from the competition. As previously mentioned, every small business uses their own unique set of software, tools, and processes to run their business. This is why it's so important to understand your client's needs and how they operate. Once you have a deep understanding of your client's needs, you can begin to build the integrations that will make your agency successful.

We have a number of [Guides](/introduction#use-cases) to help you get started with building each use case. Each of our native [Integrations](/integrations) are built to be as easy to use as possible, and we are always adding new ones. If you need to build a custom integration, you can use our [API](/developers) to connect Thoughtly to any other software your clients use.

[Automations](/build/automations/overview) are a powerful way to connect Thoughtly to any other software your clients use. You can use Automations to send data to and from Thoughtly, and you can even use them to trigger actions in other software based on events that happen in Thoughtly. This is a great way to build custom workflows for your clients without writing any code. Many of our agency partners use [Make.com](https://make.com) to connect Thoughtly to unsupported software.

#### CRMs

Outside of Thoughtly, the most important core software your clients will use is their CRM. This is where all of their customer data is stored, and it's critical that you understand how to connect Thoughtly to your client's CRM. The most popular CRMs leveraged by our agency partners are:

- [**Salesforce**](/integrations/crm/salesforce)
- [**GoHighLevel**](/integrations/crm/highlevel)
- [**HubSpot**](/integrations/crm/hubspot)
- [**Zoho**](/integrations/crm/zoho)
- [**Keap**](/integrations/crm/keap)
- [**Pipedrive**](/integrations/crm/pipedrive)

#### Scheduling

Scheduling is another critical part of your client's business. Fortunately, we have a number of [Integrations](/integrations) to help you get started with connecting Thoughtly to your client's scheduling software. The most popular scheduling software leveraged by our agency partners are:

- [**Calendly**](/integrations/scheduling/calendly)
- [**Acuity Scheduling**](/integrations/scheduling/acuity)
- [**Mindbody**](/integrations/scheduling/mindbody)
- [**Cal.com**](/integrations/scheduling/cal-com)

### Whitelabeling

Your clients will want to see the results of your work, and there are a number of ways to do this. While many agencies will display data in a custom dashboard or CRM report, Thoughtly's [Whitelabel Dashboard](/platform/settings/whitelabel) is a powerful tool to help you do this. You can use the Dashboard to show your customers a recording of each call, the outcome of each call, and data on the performance of each agent. This is a powerful way to show your clients the value of your work, and it can help you upsell them on additional services.

## Billing your Clients

Efficient and professional contracting and billing are critical to running a successful agency. They ensure clear communication with your clients, timely payments, and a smooth overall experience. Below, we'll walk through the steps, platforms, and best practices to help you streamline this aspect of your agency operations.

### Contracts: Setting the Foundation

Contracts protect both you and your clients by clearly defining the scope of work, responsibilities, and payment terms. They minimize misunderstandings and create a professional impression.

##### Key Elements of a Contract

1. **Scope of Work (SOW):** Clearly outline the services you'll provide, including specific deliverables (e.g., "Implement Voice AI solution to automate lead follow-ups").
2. **Payment Terms:** Specify the total cost, payment schedule (e.g., upfront, recurring, or milestone-based), and accepted payment methods.
3. **Timelines:** Include deadlines for project completion, milestones, or ongoing service periods.
4. **Termination Clause:** Define the terms under which the agreement can be terminated by either party.
5. **Confidentiality and Data Privacy:** Ensure compliance with data protection laws like GDPR or CCPA if applicable.
6. **Dispute Resolution:** Outline how disputes will be handled (e.g., arbitration, mediation, or legal action).
7. **Signatures:** Ensure both parties sign the agreement to make it legally binding.

**Recommended Tools for Contracts:**

- **[Salesbricks](https://www.salesbricks.com?utm_source=thoughtly)**: A CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) tool that allows you to send customized contracts, quotes, and invoices to your clients. This is a great way to get started with contracts, and you can even use it to send invoices. This is what we use at Thoughtly, and we love it.
- **[DocuSign](https://docusign.com)**: Industry-standard tool for e-signatures and contract management.
- **[Dropbox Sign](https://sign.dropbox.com)**: Simple and affordable e-signature platform suitable for small agencies.
- **[PandaDoc](https://pandadoc.com)**: Comprehensive tool for creating, sending, and managing contracts with real-time tracking.

### Billing: Streamlined and Transparent

Once the contract is in place, billing becomes the critical step to ensure you're paid for your work. A professional and organized billing process reflects well on your agency and helps avoid delays or disputes.

##### Platforms for Invoicing

1. **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**
	- A versatile payment platform that allows you to generate invoices and accept credit card payments.
	- Provides recurring billing options, making it ideal for retainer or subscription-based services.
	- Supports multiple currencies for international clients.

2. **[QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com)**
	- An all-in-one accounting solution that includes invoicing, expense tracking, and reporting.
	- Allows for integration with bank accounts and payroll services.
	- Offers customizable invoice templates and automated reminders for overdue payments.

3. **[FreshBooks](https://freshbooks.com)**
	- Tailored for small businesses and agencies, FreshBooks simplifies invoicing and payment tracking.
	- Includes time-tracking features to bill clients for hourly work.
	- Offers payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal for convenience.

4. **[Zoho Invoice](https://zoho.com/invoice)**
	- A cost-effective tool for generating invoices, with features like recurring billing and multi-currency support.
	- Integrates with the Zoho ecosystem, making it a great choice for agencies using other Zoho tools.

**Best Practices for Invoicing:**

1. **Be Timely:** Send invoices as soon as work is completed or according to the agreed schedule.
2. **Itemize Services:** Clearly list the services provided, their costs, and any applicable taxes or discounts.
3. **Include Payment Details:** Provide easy-to-follow payment instructions, including accepted methods and due dates.
4. **Set Payment Terms:** Use clear terms like “Net 15” (due in 15 days) or “Net 30” to avoid confusion.
5. **Automate Reminders:** Use invoicing tools to send automated reminders for unpaid invoices, reducing the need for manual follow-ups.

### The Importance of Contracts and Invoices Together

Contracts and invoices go hand-in-hand. While contracts establish the terms of your relationship, invoices operationalize those terms. Keeping both processes professional and streamlined enhances your agency's reputation and ensures smooth operations.

### Example Workflow for Contracting and Billing

1. **Contract Creation**: Use Salesbricks to configure a contract that includes a detailed scope of work, pricing, and timelines. Send it to the client for review and e-signature via DocuSign.
2. **Invoice Generation**: Once the contract is signed, create an invoice using QuickBooks or Stripe. Ensure it reflects the agreed payment terms.
3. **Payment Processing**: Accept payments via Stripe, which supports credit cards, ACH transfers, and international currencies.
4. **Automation**: Set up recurring invoices for retainer clients and automate reminders for overdue payments.
5. **Tracking and Reporting**: Use your invoicing tool's dashboard to track payment status and generate financial reports for internal use.

By maintaining transparency and professionalism in contracting and billing, you set the stage for a long-term, trust-based relationship with your clients. This process not only ensures your agency gets paid but also reinforces your brand as a reliable and organized partner.

## Legal and Compliance Considerations

As an AI agency, legal and compliance issues are paramount to your success. Failing to adhere to established regulations can not only damage your reputation but also lead to severe financial penalties and the potential loss of access to Thoughtly's platform. This section outlines critical compliance guidelines you must follow to protect your agency, your clients, and their customers.

### Understanding the Regulatory Landscape

The **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** has taken significant steps to protect consumers and businesses from telemarketing fraud. As an AI agency using Voice AI solutions for outbound calls, you must ensure compliance with the following key regulations:

1. **Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)**  
	- The TCPA prohibits the use of AI-generated voices in robocalls unless explicitly requested by the recipient.
	- Violations of the TCPA can result in significant financial penalties, making compliance non-negotiable.

2. **Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)**  
	- Managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the TSR sets strict requirements for telemarketing, including outbound calls made by businesses.  
	- Key requirements include disclosing the identity of the caller, providing the purpose of the call, and complying with restrictions on call timing.

3. **Do Not Call Registry**  
	- The National Do Not Call Registry prohibits telemarketing calls to numbers listed unless the recipient has provided explicit permission.
	- It is your responsibility to verify that numbers are not on this registry before making any outbound calls.

4. **AI-Specific Regulations**  
	- The FCC has explicitly affirmed that using AI-generated voices in unauthorized robocalls is illegal. This applies to both consumer and business calls.
	- Ensure that every call recipient has explicitly opted in to receive calls before initiating contact.

### How to Ensure Compliance

**1. Obtain Explicit Consent**
- **Written Consent:** Always collect clear, written consent from recipients before making any outbound calls. This consent must include acknowledgment of the use of AI in the call.
- **Document Consent:** Use CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot to maintain detailed records of consent for auditing purposes.

**2. Validate Your Contact List**
- **Check Against the Do Not Call Registry:** Regularly scrub your call lists to ensure no numbers are listed on the registry. Many platforms, such as CompliancePoint or Gryphon Networks, offer tools for list validation.  
- **Segment Your Lists:** Use segmentation to ensure you are only calling individuals or businesses that have requested information.

**3. Stay Transparent**
- **Identify Yourself and Your Purpose:** Clearly state who you are, the organization you represent, and the purpose of the call within the first few seconds.  
- **Disclose AI Usage:** Inform recipients that they are interacting with an AI agent and provide an option to speak with a human if requested.

**4. Train Your Team**
- Educate your team on the legal requirements of the TCPA, TSR, and Do Not Call regulations. Regular training can prevent unintentional violations.

**5. Use Thoughtly Features to Stay Compliant**
- **Call Documentation:** Thoughtly automatically logs and records calls, providing transparency and aiding compliance.
- **Opt-In Tracking:** Use automation tools in Thoughtly to confirm and log recipient consent before initiating any calls.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance with these regulations can lead to:

- **Financial Penalties:** Violations of the TCPA can result in fines of up to $16,000 per call.
- **Revocation of Platform Access:** Thoughtly reserves the right to revoke your access to our platform if you violate compliance requirements, as outlined in our [Terms of Use](https://thoughtly.com/terms). No refunds will be issued for revoked access due to non-compliance.
- **Legal Action:** Persistent violations could expose your agency to lawsuits, reputational harm, and loss of clients.

### Key Takeaway

*If the recipient of the call did not explicitly request the call, you should not make the call.*

By adhering to these compliance guidelines, you not only protect your agency from legal risk but also build trust with your clients and their customers. Always prioritize transparency, consent, and adherence to regulations as the foundation of your agency's operations.

## Client Retention

Client retention is the cornerstone of a successful AI agency. Acquiring new clients is costly and time-consuming, but retaining existing clients builds long-term stability and profitability. Retention is more than just delivering results—it's about fostering trust, providing ongoing value, and building lasting relationships. Below, we'll explore proven strategies to maximize client retention for your Thoughtly-powered AI agency.

### Consistent Communication

Transparent and frequent communication keeps clients informed, engaged, and confident in your services.

**Best Practices:**

- **Scheduled Check-Ins**: Set up regular calls or meetings to discuss performance, address concerns, and share updates. Weekly or biweekly check-ins work well for most clients.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use Thoughtly's [Analytics Tools](https://thoughtly.com/docs/platform/library) to provide clients with data-backed insights, such as call outcomes, conversion rates, and cost savings.
- **Dedicated Point of Contact**: Assign a dedicated account manager for each client to ensure personalized attention and quick resolution of issues.

**Example:** Schedule a quarterly business review (QBR) to discuss progress against KPIs, present new opportunities for AI solutions, and reinforce your value.

### Deliver Tangible Results

Consistently demonstrating value is essential for client satisfaction and retention.

**Best Practices:**

- **Set Clear Goals**: Define success metrics during onboarding, such as call conversion rates or customer satisfaction scores.
- **Regular Reporting**: Share progress reports through the [Whitelabel Dashboard](https://thoughtly.com/docs/platform/settings/whitelabel) or in-person presentations. Highlight measurable results like leads captured, calls handled, and time saved.
- **Proactive Recommendations**: Use insights from [Automations](https://thoughtly.com/docs/build/automations/overview) and analytics to suggest optimizations and improvements.

**Example:** A real estate client may see a 20% increase in appointment bookings within three months. Present this data visually in a custom report, emphasizing how your solutions directly impacted their business.

### Build Strong Relationships

Clients are more likely to stay with agencies that feel like partners rather than service providers.

**Best Practices:**

- **Understand Their Business**: Invest time in learning your client's industry, challenges, and goals. Tailor your solutions to align with their broader objectives.
- **Celebrate Milestones**: Recognize key achievements, such as reaching lead generation goals or launching a new product.
- **Personal Touches**: Send handwritten notes, personalized gifts, or holiday cards to show appreciation and build rapport.

**Example:** If your client achieves record sales after implementing Thoughtly, send them a congratulatory gift along with a summary of how your solutions contributed to their success.

### Offer Ongoing Training and Support

Empower clients to maximize the use of Thoughtly tools while ensuring they feel supported at every step.

**Best Practices:**

- **Customized Training**: Offer training sessions tailored to your client's specific needs. Use the [Agent Builder](https://thoughtly.com/docs/build/agent-builder/overview) as a hands-on example to guide them.
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Direct clients to Thoughtly's comprehensive [Documentation](https://thoughtly.com/docs/) and [API Reference](https://thoughtly.com/docs/api-reference) for self-service learning.
- **24/7 Support**: Provide responsive support via email, chat, or phone to address issues quickly.

**Example:** Offer monthly training webinars for clients who onboard new team members, ensuring their entire staff stays proficient in using Thoughtly's features.

### Upsell and Expand

Retaining clients doesn't just mean keeping them happy—it also means growing the relationship by offering additional services.

**Best Practices:**

- **Identify New Opportunities**: Regularly review your client's evolving needs and propose relevant upgrades or add-ons.
- **Offer Pilot Programs**: Introduce new features like AI-powered SMS campaigns or advanced integrations on a trial basis.
- **Bundle Services**: Create packages that include additional automations, custom integrations, or premium support.

**Example:** If a client uses Thoughtly for inbound calls, suggest adding an outbound campaign for appointment reminders to further streamline their operations.

### Leverage Client Feedback

Listening to your clients' feedback not only helps improve your service but also strengthens their trust in your agency.

**Best Practices:**

- **Surveys and Reviews**: Regularly collect feedback through surveys or informal check-ins to understand client satisfaction and areas for improvement.
- **Implement Changes**: Act on feedback promptly, and communicate the changes you've made as a result.
- **Encourage Testimonials**: Happy clients are your best advocates. Ask them to provide testimonials or participate in a case study.

**Example:** If clients request better visibility into AI performance, create a new section in the [Whitelabel Dashboard](https://thoughtly.com/docs/platform/settings/whitelabel) to display call success rates and agent engagement metrics.

### Proactively Address Challenges

Clients appreciate agencies that tackle problems head-on rather than waiting for issues to escalate.

**Best Practices:**

- **Monitor Performance**: Use Thoughtly's [Real-Time Reporting](https://thoughtly.com/docs/platform/library) to catch potential issues early.
- **Action Plans**: If performance dips, create a clear action plan and communicate it to the client.
- **Transparent Communication**: Be honest about challenges and work collaboratively with the client to resolve them.

**Example:** If a new AI script underperforms, schedule a meeting to review the data, identify the issue, and propose improvements.

### Foster Community and Engagement

Clients who feel part of a larger community are more likely to stay loyal.

**Best Practices:**

- **Client Events**: Host exclusive webinars, workshops, or Q&A sessions to showcase new features and best practices.
- **Peer Networking**: Connect clients with similar businesses for shared insights and mutual support.
- **Social Media Engagement**: Highlight client successes on Thoughtly's social platforms to build community and celebrate achievements.

**Example:** Create a “Client Spotlight” series that features success stories, tips, and testimonials from your top clients.

### Why Client Retention Matters

Retention is not about holding clients hostage—it's about creating partnerships so valuable they wouldn't think of going elsewhere. By focusing on consistent communication, delivering results, and fostering strong relationships, your agency can build a loyal client base that drives sustainable growth. Remember, every satisfied client is not just a win but an advocate for your agency, helping you grow organically through referrals and trust.
