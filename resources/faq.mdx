#### Can I choose my own LLM?

Thoughtly uses best-in-class language models to ensure the highest quality of conversation and adhearance to the instructions you provide to the <a href="build/agent-builder">Agent Builder.</a> Because of the importance of instruction following, ethics, and quality, choosing your own language model is not supported at this time.

#### What language models does Thoughtly use?

We use a number of different models from vendors such as Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. We are constantly evaluating new models and will update our platform as new models become available.

#### Can I resell Thoughtly services?

Applications to join the Thoughtly Reseller Program are reviewed on a rolling basis. Please submit your request to <a href="mailto:sales@thought.ly">sales@thought.ly</a> for consideration.

#### Who is Thoughtly best for?

There are two main concepts that, if applicable, make Thoughtly a great fit for your business:

1. **Unique Scripting Requirements**: As a horizontal platform, Thoughtly is designed to be flexible and customizable to meet your unique scripting requirements. If you have a complex script that you need your Voice Agents to adhere to, Thoughtly is a great fit. However, sometimes a vertical solution may be a better fit for your needs if you have a simple script that can be easily implemented with a pre-built solution.
2. **Out-of-the-Box Integrations**: Thoughtly has numerous [integrations](/integrations) with popular software tools and services. If you use any of these tools, Thoughtly is a great fit for your business. If not, you can use Thoughtly's [API Node](/build/agent-builder/nodes#api-node) and [Developer API](/developers) to build custom integrations. If you're in need of programatic agent building or an embedded solution, such as for your own software solution, Thoughtly may not be the best fit.

#### How much does Thoughtly cost?

Thoughtly is priced on a per-minute basis. You can view our pricing <a href="https://thought.ly">on our website</a>.

#### I'm using a common software tool, but it's not [listed in your integrations](/integrations). Can you integrate with it?

We are constantly adding new integrations to our platform. If you have a specific integration you need, please let us know by sending us a message via the chat widget in the bottom right corner of the screen.

#### Can Thoughtly integrate with a proprietary software solution?

Absolutley. Our team builds custom integrations for customers on a case-by-case basis. [Book a demo](https://fns.thought.ly/lead/email?demo=true) to discuss your needs with our team.

#### Can I use my own telephony, [STT](/resources/glossary#stt), or [TTS](/resources/glossary#tts) providers?

Thoughtly is designed for ease of use to provide <i>anyone</i> with the ability to build and deploy Voice Agents, not just engineers. We have carefully selected our partners to ensure the best possible experience for our customers. As such, we do not support the use of external telephony, STT, or TTS providers at this time.
