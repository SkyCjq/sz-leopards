## Introduction

Arm your agents with advanced automation capabilities to authenticate callers quickly and resolve customer service issues seamlessly. Thoughtly connects directly to your CRM, scheduling tools, SaaS platforms, and more, enabling your Voice Agent to act autonomously on your behalf.

After [building a Voice Agent](/build/overview.mdx) using our drag-and-drop interface, you can connect it to your existing systems using either [Integration Nodes](/build/agent-builder/nodes#integration-node), our [API](/developers), or [Automations](/build/automations/overview). This allows you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and provide a more personalized experience for your callers.

Thoughtly is built for non-developers, so you can build and deploy integrations without writing a single line of code. Using our powerful suite of Integrations, you can connect your Voice Agents to the tools you already use.
