## Building your first Voice Agent

When you first found Thoughtly, you likely had a specific use case in mind. From customer service to sales, appointment reminders to preliminary intake, every Voice Agent can be broken down into three main stages:

<Steps>
	<Step title="Pre-Call Triggers">
		For outbound calling, <a href="/build/automations/triggers">Triggers</a> are what initiate the call itself. Using <a href="/build/automations">Automations</a>, your Voice Agent can connect to your CRM, calendar, or other systems to be instructed on when to make a call. For example, <a href="/use-cases/outbound/sales">a call can be made every time a new lead is added to your CRM.</a>
	</Step>
	<Step title="Agent Call">
		There are three main components to the call itself: <a href="/build/agent-builder/overview">Call Scripting</a>, <a href="/build/genius">Genius Knowledge</a>, and <a href="/build/agent-builder/nodes">Mid-Call Actions</a>. Provide the script as the Voice Agent's "happy path," use Knowledge to answer questions that may arise, and use Actions to connect other software, transfer calls, and perform other tasks.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Post-Call Actions">
		After the call is complete, <a href="/build/automations/actions">Actions</a> can be taken to update your CRM, send an email, continue an outbound sequence, or perform other tasks. For example, if the caller didn't answer, you can try again the next day, then <a href="/deploy/sms">send an SMS</a> to follow up.
	</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>With this in mind, start to consider how your ideal Voice Agent would conform to these stages. Would it be triggered by external software, or via an inbound phone call? What is the agent doing during the call, and what should happen after the call is complete?</Tip>
