## Agent Settings

On the right hand side of the Agent Builder, you'll find all of the settings for your Voice Agent. This is where you can configure your Agent's voice, personality, language, knowledge, and more.

Here, you can change the name of your Agent, choose the [type of conversation](/build/agent-builder/conversation-types) you want to build, select a voice, and set the [Agent's language](/resources/faq#what-languages-does-thoughtly-support).
