## Introduction

Genius is Thoughtly's in-house [RAG](/resources/glossary#rag-retrieval-augmented-generation) system that provides your Voice Agent with access to a vast amount of knowledge you provide. By enabling Genius, your Voice Agent will be able to answer a wide range of questions and provide detailed information to callers.

<Warning>Genius is not used to provide prompts or instructions to your Voice Agent. Instead, it is used to provide detailed, unstructured information to callers. For special prompting or instructions, use the [Custom Prompt](#custom-prompt) setting.</Warning>
