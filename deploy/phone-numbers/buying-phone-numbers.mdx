## Introduction

Phone numbers are a key component of your Voice Agents. They allow you to make and receive calls, send and receive SMS messages, and more. You can buy phone numbers from Thoughtly and connect them to your Voice Agents to get started.

To make it easier to manage your phone numbers, Thoughtly provides a simple system for provisioning and releasing phone numbers using "credits."

## Phone number credits

Phone numbers on Thoughtly are managed using "credits." For each credit you have, you can buy a phone number and connect it to your Voice Agent. You can also release a phone number to free up a credit for another number.

Without [talking to sales](https://fns.thought.ly/lead/email?demo=true), you can buy up to 25 phone numbers on your account. If you need more than 25 phone numbers, please reach out to our team.

### Buying phone number credits

To buy phone number credits, head to the [Billing](/platform/billing) section of your account. You can choose the number of credits you'd like to purchase by dragging the slider, then clicking "Subscribe."

## Provisioning a phone number

Once you have phone number credits, you can provision a new phone number from the [Phone Numbers](https://app.thought.ly/phone-number) section of your account. Once on the phone numbers page, click "Buy a phone number" to get started.

On this page, you can search for available phone numbers by area code, city, or country. Once you find a number you like, click "Buy" to connect it to your account.

## Releasing a phone number

If you no longer need a phone number, you can release it to free up a credit for another number. To release a phone number, head to the [Phone Numbers](https://app.thought.ly/phone-number) section of your account, click the three dots next to the number you want to release, then click "Cancel."
