## Introduction

Phone numbers are a key component of your Voice Agents. They allow you to make and receive calls, send and receive SMS messages, and more. You can buy phone numbers from Thoughtly and connect them to your Voice Agents to get started.

To make it easier to manage your phone numbers, Thoughtly provides a simple system for provisioning and releasing phone numbers using "Credits." Read more about Credits in the [Billing](/platform/billing) section of the documentation.

## Credits and phone numbers

Phone numbers on Thoughtly are managed using "Credits." Using Credits, you can buy a phone number and connect it to your Voice Agent. You can also release a phone number if you want to switch to a different number.

## Provisioning a phone number

Once you have a sufficient Credit balance, you can provision a new phone number from the [Phone Numbers](https://app.thought.ly/phone-number) section of your account. Once on the phone numbers page, click "Buy a phone number" to get started.

On this page, you can search for available phone numbers by area code, city, or country. Once you find a number you like, click "Buy" to connect it to your account.

## Releasing a phone number

If you no longer need a phone number, you can release it to free up a credit for another number. To release a phone number, head to the [Phone Numbers](https://app.thought.ly/phone-number) section of your account, click the three dots next to the number you want to release, then click "Cancel."
