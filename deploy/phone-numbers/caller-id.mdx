## Introduction

Caller ID allows you to mask your outbound calls with a custom phone number. By setting a custom Caller ID, you can control the number that appears on the recipient's phone when you make a call.

Want to use an existing phone number for outbound calls, but don't want to port it to Thoughtly? You can use your existing phone number as a custom Caller ID.

## Getting Started

To set a custom Caller ID for your outbound calls, first head to the [Caller ID](https://app.thought.ly/phone-number/caller-id) section of the Thoughtly dashboard. Once there, you can click "Add Caller ID" to add a new number.

When you add a new Caller ID, you'll be prompted to enter the phone number you'd like to use.

After you've entered your phone number, you'll receive a verification call from Thoughtly. Answer the call and enter the verification code provided to complete the process.

Once your Caller ID has been verified, you can use it for outbound calls.

## Connecting Your Voice Agent

To use your custom Caller ID with your Voice Agent, you can connect it to an Agent by configuring the table on the Caller ID page.
