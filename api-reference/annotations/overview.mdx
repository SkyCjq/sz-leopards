## Intro

With the Annotations API, you can annotate traces with additional information. This is useful if you want to add additional information to a trace, such as a comment or a thumbs up/down reaction.

## Authentication

To make a call to the Annotations API, you will need to pass through your LangWatch API key in the header as `X-Auth-Token`. Your API key can be found on the setup page under settings.
