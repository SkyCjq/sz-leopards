## Introduction

Welcome to the Thoughtly Developer Documentation! Here you'll find everything you need to build and deploy Voice Agents with Thoughtly.

After [building a Voice Agent](/build/overview.mdx) using our drag-and-drop interface, you can deploy it using our powerful API. This allows you to integrate your Voice Agent with your existing systems, or build custom integrations to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to [create an API key](/api/keys) in the [Thoughtly dashboard](https://app.thought.ly). This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the API.

## API Reference

Our API is designed to be simple and easy to use. You can interact with your Voice Agents using RESTful HTTP requests.
