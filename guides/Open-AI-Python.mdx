To integrate LangWatch with OpenAI's GPT models using Python, follow these steps:

import Prerequisites from "/snippets/prerequests.mdx";

<Prerequisites />
**Usage:**

Use the `OpenAITracer` context manager, passing the OpenAI instance to it to
automatically trace all interactions within its block

```python
import langwatch.openai
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Use the LangWatch tracer for the OpenAI model
with langwatch.openai.OpenAITracer(
  client,
  metadata={
      "user_id": "optional-user-123",
      "thread_id": "optional-thread-456",
  },
):
    # Your interaction with OpenAI's API
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about elephants."},
        ]
    )
```

This will trace all spans within the block. Spans are created for each
API call made to OpenAI during the lifecycle of a trace.
