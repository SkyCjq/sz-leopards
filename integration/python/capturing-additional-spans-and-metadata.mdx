By using LangWatch integrations, all the calls to LLMs should be automatically captured, and by using the RAG context tracking, you can pass in also the context. However, sometimes it might be useful to add a new piece of metadata that you only figure out in the middle of your LLM pipeline, for example, tagging it with a new label. You can do that by exposing the tracer in the context manager, and appending new metadata. For example, for the OpenAI tracer:

```python
import langwatch.openai
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

with langwatch.openai.OpenAITracer(
  client,
  metadata={
      "user_id": "optional-user-123",
      "thread_id": "optional-thread-456",
      # Initialize labels as empty
      "labels": []
  },
) as tracer:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about elephants."},
        ]
    )
    # Append the label after calling the LLM
    tracer.metadata["labels"] += ["joke"]
```

And here is an example if you are using LangChain tracer:

```import langwatch.langchain
from langchain.llms import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

model = ChatOpenAI()
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("tell me a joke about {topic}")
chain = prompt | model

with langwatch.langchain.LangChainTracer(
  metadata={
    "user_id": "optional-user-123",
    "thread_id": "optional-thread-456",
    #  Initialize labels as empty
    "labels": []
  }
) as langWatchCallback:
    result = chain.invoke(
        {"topic": "bears"},
        config={"callbacks": [langWatchCallback]}
    )
    # Append the label after calling the LLM
    langWatchCallback.metadata["labels"] += ["joke"]
```

# Appending new spans

You can also append new spans other than the ones automatically captured by LangWatch tracer, take a look on `tracer.append_span` on the [Custom Python Integration](./custom-Python).
