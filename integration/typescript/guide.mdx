LangWatch library is the easiest way to integrate your TypeScript application with LangWatch, the messages are synced on the background so it doesn't intercept or block your LLM calls.

import Prerequisites from "/snippets/prerequests-ts.mdx";

<Prerequisites />


## Capturing Messages

- Each message triggering your LLM pipeline as a whole is captured with a [Trace](/concepts#traces).
- A [Trace](/concepts#traces) contains multiple [Spans](/concepts#spans), which are the steps inside your pipeline.
  - A span can be an LLM call, a database query for a RAG retrieval, or a simple function transformation.
  - Different types of [Spans](/concepts#spans) capture different parameters.
  - [Spans](/concepts#spans) can be nested to capture the pipeline structure.
- [Traces](/concepts#traces) can be grouped together on LangWatch Dashboard by having the same [`thread_id`](/concepts#threads) in their metadata, making the individual messages become part of a conversation.
  - It is also recommended to provide the [`user_id`](/concepts#user-id) metadata to track user analytics.


## Create a Trace

```typescript
// Trace creation
const trace = langwatch.getTrace({
  metadata: { threadId: "mythread-123", userId: "myuser-123" },
});

// Example of updating the metadata to add labels to the trace if needed
trace.update({
  metadata: { labels: ["customer-support"] },
});
```

## Capture an LLM Span
<Tabs>
<Tab title="OpenAI">
To capture your LLM calls, you can start an LLM span inside the trace with the input about to be sent to the LLM.

First, define the model and the messages you are going to use for your LLM call separately, so you can capture them:

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

// Model to be used and messages that will be sent to the LLM
const model = "gpt-4o"
const messages : OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Write a tweet-size vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.",
  },
]
```

Then, start the LLM span from the trace, giving it the model and input messages:

```typescript
const span = trace.startLLMSpan({
  name: "llm",
  model: model,
  input: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: messages
  },
});
```

This will capture the LLM input and register the time the call started. Now, continue with the LLM call normally, using the same parameters:

```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI();
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: messages,
  model: model,
});
```

Finally, after the OpenAI call is done, end the span to get the finish timestamp to be registered, and capture the output and the token metrics, which will be used for cost calculation:

```typescript
span.end({
  output: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: [chatCompletion.choices[0]!.message],
  },
  metrics: {
    promptTokens: chatCompletion.usage?.prompt_tokens,
    completionTokens: chatCompletion.usage?.completion_tokens,
  },
});
```

To capture your LLM calls, you can start an LLM span inside the trace with the input about to be sent to the LLM.

First, define the model and the messages you are going to use for your LLM call separately, so you can capture them:

```typescript
import { AzureOpenAI } from "openai";

// Model to be used and messages that will be sent to the LLM
const model = "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09"
const messages : OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Write a tweet-size vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.",
  },
]
```

Then, start the LLM span from the trace, giving it the model and input messages:

```typescript
const span = trace.startLLMSpan({
  name: "llm",
  model: model,
  input: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: messages
  },
});
```

This will capture the LLM input and register the time the call started. Now, continue with the LLM call normally, using the same parameters:

```typescript
const openai = new AzureOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
  apiVersion: "2024-02-01",
  endpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
});
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: messages,
  model: model,
});
```

Finally, after the OpenAI call is done, end the span to get the finish timestamp to be registered, and capture the output and the token metrics, which will be used for cost calculation:

```typescript
span.end({
  output: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: [chatCompletion.choices[0]!.message],
  },
  metrics: {
    promptTokens: chatCompletion.usage?.prompt_tokens,
    completionTokens: chatCompletion.usage?.completion_tokens,
  },
});
```

<Tab title="Vercel AI SDK">
To capture your LLM calls, you can start an LLM span inside the trace with the input about to be sent to the LLM.

First, define the model and the messages you are going to use for your LLM call separately, so you can capture them:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText, type CoreMessage } from "ai";

// Model to be used and messages that will be sent to the LLM
const model = openai("gpt-4o");
const messages: CoreMessage[] = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Write a tweet-size vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.",
  },
];
```

Then, start the LLM span from the trace, giving it the model and input messages, use the `convertFromVercelAIMessages` utility to convert the input messages from Vercel AI SDK to the format expected by LangWatch:

```typescript
import { convertFromVercelAIMessages } from "langwatch";

const span = trace.startLLMSpan({
  name: "llm",
  model: model.modelId,
  input: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: convertFromVercelAIMessages(messages),
  },
});
```

This will capture the LLM input and register the time the call started. Now, continue with the LLM call normally, using the same parameters:

```typescript
const response = await generateText({
  model: model,
  messages: messages,
});
```

Finally, after the Vercel AI SDK call is done, end the span to get the finish timestamp to be registered, and capture the output and the token metrics, which will be used for cost calculation:

```typescript
span.end({
  output: {
    type: "chat_messages",
    value: convertFromVercelAIMessages(response.responseMessages),
  },
  metrics: {
    promptTokens: response.usage?.promptTokens,
    completionTokens: response.usage?.completionTokens,
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="LangChain.js">
To capture your LLM calls and all other chain steps, LangWatch provides a callback hook for LangChain.js that automatically tracks everything for you.

First, define your chain as you would normally do:

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from '@langchain/core/output_parsers'
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from '@langchain/core/prompts'
import { ChatOpenAI } from '@langchain/openai'

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ['system', 'Translate the following from English into Italian'],
  ['human', '{input}']
])
const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })
const outputParser = new StringOutputParser()

const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(outputParser)
```

Now, when calling your chain either with `invoke` or `stream`, pass in `trace.getLangChainCallback()` as one of the callbacks:

```typescript
const stream = await chain.stream(
  { input: message },
  { callbacks: [trace.getLangChainCallback()] }
)
```

That's it! The full trace with all spans for each chain step will be sent automatically to LangWatch in the background on periodic intervals. After capturing your first LLM Span, go to [LangWatch Dashboard](https://app.langwatch.com), your message should be there!
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
On short-live environments like Lambdas or Serverless Functions, be sure to call <br /> `await trace.sendSpans();` to wait for all pending requests to be sent before the runtime is destroyed.
</Note>

## Capture a RAG Span

Appart from LLM spans, another very used type of span is the RAG span. This is used to capture the retrieved contexts from a RAG that will be used by the LLM, and enables a whole new set of RAG-based features evaluations for RAG quality on LangWatch.

import TypeScriptRAG from "/snippets/typescript-rag.mdx";

<TypeScriptRAG />

## Capture an arbritary Span

You can also use generic spans to capture any type of operation, its inputs and outputs, for example for a function call:

```typescript
// before the function starts
const span = trace.startSpan({
  name: "weather_function",
  input: {
    type: "json",
    value: {
      city: "Tokyo",
    },
  },
});

// ...after the function ends
span.end({
  output: {
    type: "json",
    value: {
      weather: "sunny",
    },
  },
});
```

You can also nest spans one inside the other, capturing your pipeline structure, for example:

```typescript
const span = trace.startSpan({
  name: "pipeline",
});

const nestedSpan = span.startSpan({
  name: "nested_pipeline",
});

nestedSpan.end()

span.end()
```

Both LLM and RAG spans can also be nested like any arbritary span.

## Capturing Exceptions

To capture also when your code throws an exception, you can simply wrap your code around a try/catch, and update or end the span with the exception:

```typescript
try {
  throw new Error("unexpected error");
} catch (error) {
  span.end({
    error: error,
  });
}
```
