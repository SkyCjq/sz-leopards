To capture a RAG span, you can use the `@langwatch.span(type="rag")` decorator, along with a call to `.update()` to add the `contexts` to the span:

```python
@langwatch.span(type="rag")
def rag_retrieval():
    # the documents you retrieved from your vector database
    search_results = ["France is a country in Europe.", "Paris is the capital of France."]

    # capture them on the span contexts before returning
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(contexts=search_results)

    return search_results
```

If you have document or chunk ids from the results, we recommend you can to capture them along with the id using `RAGChunk`, as this allows them to be grouped together and generate documents analytics on LangWatch dashboard:

```python
from langwatch.types import RAGChunk

@langwatch.span(type="rag")
def rag_retrieval():
    # the documents you retrieved from your vector database
    search_results = [
        {
            "id": "doc-1",
            "content": "France is a country in Europe.",
        },
        {
            "id": "doc-2",
            "content": "Paris is the capital of France.",
        },
    ]

    # capture then on the span contexts with RAGChunk before returning
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(
        contexts=[
            RAGChunk(
                document_id=document["id"],
                content=document["content"],
            )
            for document in search_results
        ]
    )

    return search_results
```

Then you'll be able to see the captured contexts that will also be used later on for evaluatios on LangWatch dashboard:
