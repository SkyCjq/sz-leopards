				<h3>Actions</h3>

				Actions are available both via <a href="/build/agent-builder/nodes">Mid-Call Actions</a> and <a href="/build/automations/actions">Automations</a>. You can give your Voice Agents access to these Actions so they can perform tasks in {name} during a call, or use them in Automations to automate tasks before and after calls.
