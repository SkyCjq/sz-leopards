To capture a RAG, you can simply start a RAG span inside the trace, giving it the input query being used:

```typescript
const ragSpan = trace.startRAGSpan({
  name: "my-vectordb-retrieval", // optional
  input: { type: "text", value: "search query" },
});

// proceed to do the retrieval normally
```

Then, after doing the retrieval, you can end the RAG span with the contexts that were retrieved and will be used by the LLM:

```typescript
ragSpan.end({
  contexts: [
    {
      documentId: "doc1",
      content: "document chunk 1",
    },
    {
      documentId: "doc2",
      content: "document chunk 2",
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
On LangChain.js, RAG spans are captured automatically by the LangWatch callback when using LangChain Retrievers, with `source` as the documentId.
